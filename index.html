        <p> Many of us are looking foward to the end of the school year like most kids, 
            however, 
            it is important to look at how we have grown and the work we have done.
            During school, especially intersession students were able to learn a variety of things that could help them in the future,
            as you can see, mine was web design. Taking this class really impacted what I wanted to learn how to do. 
            In previous years, I had used a bit of css and html and wanted to learn a lot more of it,
            through this class and my digital prototyping class, I was able to learn so much more about how HTML and CSS works and I am happy with that.
            learning coding has opened up another world of opportunities and things that I can learn over this quarantine and I really enjoy it.

                I think another impactful thing on everyone was the stay at home order because of this pandemic.
                While I certanily didn't like it, as most didn't as well, this was a good time to reflect on what you have done and explore some new things.
                Something that I was able to learn and get to do with my family, was baking. While I am not the greatest, nor did I think I would do it,
                it has been fun hanging out with family and making some baked goods.

                I guess I'm grateful for terraria during this quarantine because I have been able to play with friends on this game.
                Also because its a super long grindy game, we haven't ran out of things to do in it. Overall I just enjoy this game
                because I can connect with friends and talk to them while also being able to play an enjoyable game.
