        <p>
            Especially with this school year coming to a close, and the year almost half way done, many of us are having higher hopes for next year and what can come of that.
            I for one would like some change from what has happened this year overall, whether it be the police issues, the virus/quarantine, or the environmental problems we need to fix,
            I hope that humanity can find a middle ground and work together to solve these problems.
        </p>
